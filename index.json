We have sub-divided the analysis into different cases based on the presence of RFI at the relay, source and destination. First, the end-to-end signal-to-noise-plus-distortion-and-error ratio (SNDER) expression is derived, followed by an exact closed-form outage probability (OP) expression for Nakagami-m fading channel. As a special case, the OP analysis for Rayleigh fading channel is also provided. From the derived expressions, the relation amongst CEE and RFI is analyzed. For a complete study, the high SNR analysis of the derived equations is also carried out. The analytical results have been verified using the Monte Carlo simulations. Intriguing results are presented with the help of plots shown in the numerical analysis. Here, we have presented plots which deal with different channel conditions. Further, plots comparing symmetric and asymmetric channels are also presented.","tags":[],"title":"Dual-Hop Decode-and-Forward Relaying in the Combined Presence of CEE and RFI: Performance Analysis and Comparison","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anoop Kumar Mishra","Debmalya Mallick","Mareesh Issar","Poonam Singh"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"1a64dbeb23fd3d2cad5e7e32a7a89239","permalink":"https://mareeshissar.github.io/publication/comsnets_paper/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/comsnets_paper/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the performance analysis of decode-and-forward (DF) relaying system in presence of both channel estimation error (CEE) and radio frequency impairments (RFI).
