A potential solution is the addition of small base stations, overlaid upon the macro base station, installed at locations encountering traffic hotspot or a coverage gap. However, the addition of base stations leads to an increase in the overall static network power consumption. Algorithms for energy efficiency aim to strike a balance between network throughput and power consumption. In this work, we evaluate several existing optimization based user association algorithms focusing on load balancing and power minimization metrics. Verification of the performance for all user association algorithms is carried out using MATLAB based system level simulator for a network topology comprising of one macro and four pico base stations considering static users. Motivated by the gains demonstrated using optimization based schemes, we consider the design of a lower complexity class of heuristic user association algorithms with comparable performance. The proposed E-ASSOC algorithm utilizes load at each base station and the difference amongst the two best Signal to Noise Ratios (SNRs) for each user as its threshold metrics. Simulation results demonstrate a gain of 41.26% in the total system throughput along with reduction of 32.96% in the system power consumption. Eventually indicating an increase of 87.83% in energy efficiency over the baseline max-SNR based association algorithm along with decrease of 7.2% for load balancing algorithm and 10.13% for power minimization algorithm. Fairness of the algorithms examined using Jain‚Äôs Fairness Index (JFI) also shows marked improvement over the baseline scheme.\n","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601510400,"objectID":"cdccae6c432245743cf205d0a191630f","permalink":"https://mareeshissar.github.io/publication/masters_thesis/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/masters_thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Future cellular networks need to reduce their carbon footprint in view of rapidly increasing data traffic from emerging applications including Augmented Reality (AR)/ Virtual Reality (VR), autonomous vehicles and Internet of Things (IoT).","tags":[],"title":"E-ASSOC: Enhanced Energy Efficient User ASSOCiation Algorithm for Future Cellular Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mareesh Kumar Issar"],"categories":null,"content":"https://mareeshissar.medium.com/the-frisbee-perspective-gliding-into-research-one-disc-at-a-time-95bbfed019c7\n","date":1599436800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://mareeshissar.github.io/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2020-09-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Understanding research through a game of flying discs.","tags":null,"title":"The frisbee perspectiveü•è, Gliding into research one disc at a time","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583758800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583758800,"objectID":"cf5ca02b5f8354446e7c90695a1de381","permalink":"https://mareeshissar.github.io/talk/design-and-implementation-of-content-routing-protocol/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/design-and-implementation-of-content-routing-protocol/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Design and Implementation of Content Routing Protocol","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Generated colorized version of a grayscale image (240 pixels X 420 pixels) using K-means clustering and Artificial Neural Network Explored K-means clustering algorithm to reduce the color palette of the image from 16777216 possible combinations to 29 most dominant colors Implemented a two Layer Artificial Neural Network consisting of 60 nodes with sigmoid activation function in the hidden layer and softmax activation function in the output layer Resolved ambiguity present in mapping multiple RGB values to a single grayscale value by taking a 3 X 3 window of pixels to make use of the contextual information present around a single grayscale pixel  ","date":1575166619,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575166619,"objectID":"88fcc0fb628f8d71bd8a273989832748","permalink":"https://mareeshissar.github.io/project/colorizer/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T02:16:59Z","relpermalink":"/project/colorizer/","section":"project","summary":"Generated colourized version of a grayscale image using K-means clustering and Artificial Neural Network.","tags":null,"title":"Colorizer","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Used Bayesian inference for tracking the location of a target hidden in a multi-terrain landscape by using the following rules:\n Searching the cell with the highest probability of finding the target Searching the cell with the highest probability of containing the target  ","date":1572573675,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572573675,"objectID":"93b61327eba975aa199fae67108ee9c5","permalink":"https://mareeshissar.github.io/project/bayesian_hunting/","publishdate":"2019-11-01T02:01:15Z","relpermalink":"/project/bayesian_hunting/","section":"project","summary":"Used Bayesian inference for tracking the location of a target hidden in a multi-terrain landscape.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian hunting","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Created an agent to play the game of minesweeper by taking inference informed actions using the following levels of inference:\n Baseline Inference -
